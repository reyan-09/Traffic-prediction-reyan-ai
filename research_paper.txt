Title: Enhancing Road Safety with AI-Driven Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction

Abstract:
Road safety is a critical concern worldwide, and emerging technologies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising solutions. This paper explores AI-driven methods for analyzing and predicting traffic accidents to enhance road safety. Machine learning algorithms are applied to historical traffic data to identify patterns and forecast potential accident hotspots. Real-time data processing, integration with IoT sensors, and predictive analytics are discussed as key components in this framework. The proposed system demonstrates potential in reducing accident rates and improving traffic management.
